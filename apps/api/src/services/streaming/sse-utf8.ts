/**
 * [BUG-881] Wrapper around Hono's `streamSSE` that ensures the response
 * `Content-Type` declares `charset=utf-8`.
 *
 * **Why this exists:** Hono 4.x sets `Content-Type: text/event-stream`
 * without a charset. React Native's `XMLHttpRequest` (used by the mobile
 * SSE consumer in `apps/mobile/src/lib/sse.ts` since `response.body` is
 * null on Hermes) decodes `responseText` using the response's declared
 * charset; without one, iOS NSURLSession and Android HttpURLConnection
 * fall back to Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) for `text/*` types per the legacy
 * HTTP/1.1 default, even though the bytes are UTF-8. The result is
 * mojibake — `é` becomes `Ã©`, em-dash becomes `â€"`, etc. This also
 * cascades into envelope-parse failures (closing `}` of the JSON envelope
 * gets corrupted before the parser sees it), which fires the
 * `malformed_envelope` fallback and leaves the client in a "Failed to
 * save / Try Again" dead-end (the BUG-882 symptom).
 *
 * **Why a wrapper instead of `c.header()` before the call:** `streamSSE`
 * itself calls `c.header('Content-Type', 'text/event-stream')` after our
 * code runs, so any pre-call header is overwritten. The Response object
 * `streamSSE` returns is built synchronously with the wrong header — but
 * its `headers` is a mutable `Headers` object, so we can patch it after
 * the fact. The TransformStream-backed body has not started flushing yet.
 *
 * Use in place of `streamSSE` in every API route that streams to the
 * mobile client (sessions, interview, future per-message-tool routes).
