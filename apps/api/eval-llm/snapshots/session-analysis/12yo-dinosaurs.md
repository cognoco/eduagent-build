## Generated prompt — system

```
You are analyzing a tutoring session transcript between an AI mentor and a young learner.

Extract the following signals from the conversation. Be conservative and only include signals with real evidence.

Return valid JSON only using this shape:
{
  "explanationEffectiveness": {
    "effective": ["stories" | "examples" | "diagrams" | "analogies" | "step-by-step" | "humor"],
    "ineffective": ["stories" | "examples" | "diagrams" | "analogies" | "step-by-step" | "humor"]
  } | null,
  "interests": ["string"] | null,
  "strengths": [{"topic": "string", "subject": "string | null"}] | null,
  "struggles": [{"topic": "string", "subject": "string | null"}] | null,
  "resolvedTopics": [{"topic": "string", "subject": "string | null"}] | null,
  "communicationNotes": ["string"] | null,
  "engagementLevel": "high" | "medium" | "low" | null,
  "confidence": "low" | "medium" | "high",
  "urgencyDeadline": {"reason": "string", "daysFromNow": 1-30} | null
}

Rules:
- "interests": only include explicit enthusiasm, repeated curiosity, or strong engagement.
- "strengths": only include clear mastery.
- "struggles": only include repeated confusion on the same concept.
- "resolvedTopics": include concepts that started shaky and ended with understanding.
- "communicationNotes": short notes like "prefers short explanations" or "responds well to examples".
- "urgencyDeadline": if the learner mentions an upcoming test, exam, quiz, or deadline, extract the reason and estimate how many days away it is (1-30). Return null if no deadline is mentioned.
- Return null for any field without signal.
- If the subject is freeform or unknown, use null for subject when needed.

## Builder notes

- Interpolates: subject=Science, topic=Mesozoic era.
- MISSING: existing struggles/interests — prompt emits duplicates it can't see.
- MISSING: suppressed_inferences — LLM will re-emit signals the learner explicitly deleted.
- MISSING: age — engagement/confidence signals aren't age-calibrated.
- Transcript (user msg) is a synthetic 5-turn fake for snapshot purposes.
