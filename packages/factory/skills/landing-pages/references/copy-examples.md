# Copy Examples Reference

Real examples from high-traffic 2025 landing pages, organized by copy element.

## Headlines

### Outcome-Focused

| Headline | Product | Why It Works |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| "Your first AI employee" | Genspark | Concrete outcome (hiring replacement), not features |
| "Create stunning apps & websites by chatting with AI" | Bolt.new | Outcome + method in one |
| "#1 undetectable AI for meetings" | Cluely | Specific outcome + ranking claim |

### Category-Defining

| Headline | Product | Why It Works |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| "The World's Largest Prediction Market" | Polymarket | Category + superlative |
| "Hands On AI" | Manus | New category name (AI that acts) |
| "The Linktree for founders" | Founder.site | Familiar reference + specific audience |

### Direct Value

| Headline | Product | Why It Works |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| "What can I do for you?" | Manus | Prompt-style, implies capability |
| "Less structure, more intelligence" | Manus | Contrast pattern, memorable |
| "One prompt, job done" | Genspark | Action + result, very concise |

### Patterns to Avoid

❌ "Revolutionize your workflow" — vague, overused
❌ "The future of [X]" — cliché, no concrete value
❌ "Unlock the power of AI" — meaningless buzzwords
❌ "Your all-in-one solution" — says nothing specific

## Subheadlines

### Expansion Pattern

**Headline**: "#1 undetectable AI for meetings"
**Subheadline**: "Cluely takes perfect meeting notes and gives real-time answers, all while completely undetectable"

Why: Expands on HOW, adds key benefit (real-time), reinforces differentiator (undetectable).

### Audience + Action Pattern

**Headline**: "Hands On AI"
**Subheadline**: "Manus is a general AI agent that bridges the gap between thinking and doing"

Why: Defines what it is, explains the value proposition simply.

### Feature List Pattern

**Headline**: "Your first AI employee"
**Subheadline**: "AI Slides, AI Sheets, AI Docs, AI Developer, AI Designer, AI Chat, AI Image, AI Video—powered by the best models"

Why: Shows breadth, creates confidence, ends with quality signal.

### Length Guidelines

- Optimal: 15-25 words
- Maximum: 35 words
- Format: 1-2 sentences
- Avoid: Jargon, multiple commas, semicolons

## CTAs

### Primary CTAs by Context

| Context | CTA | Why |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Very early concept | "Join the waitlist" | Low commitment, implies exclusivity |
| Building with updates | "Get early access" | Implies benefit for early supporters |
| Beta product ready | "Request access" | Suggests curation/quality control |
| Product launching | "Get started free" | Removes friction, implies freemium |
| Product live | "Try free" or "Start free trial" | Action-oriented |
| Enterprise focus | "Book a demo" | Matches buying process |

### Secondary CTAs

| Primary | Secondary | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| "Join waitlist" | "Learn more" | For skeptics |
| "Get early access" | "See how it works" | Reduce uncertainty |
| "Get started free" | "View pricing" | For serious buyers |
| "Book a demo" | "Watch video" | Self-serve option |

### CTA Microcopy

Add below or near CTA to reduce friction:

- "No credit card required"
- "Free forever for small teams"
- "Takes 30 seconds"
- "Join 2,000+ on the waitlist"
- "We'll never spam you"

### CTAs to Avoid

❌ "Submit" — impersonal, form-like
❌ "Click here" — meaningless
❌ "Sign up now!" — pushy exclamation
❌ "Subscribe" — implies newsletters, not product

## Social Proof Copy

### Metrics Format

| Good | Why | Avoid | Why Not |
|------|-----|-------|---------|
| "12,000+ on waitlist" | Specific, growing | "Many users" | Vague |
| "5M+ conversations" | Shows usage | "Millions served" | Cliché |
| "$4M ARR" | Credible for B2B | "Fast growing" | Unverifiable |
| "99.24% accuracy" | Specific claim | "High accuracy" | Meaningless |

### Logo Strip Labels

- "Trusted by teams at"
- "Backed by"
- "Featured in"
- "Used by engineers at"
- "As seen in"

### Testimonial Format

Keep short. Include specifics.

**Good**:
> "Cluely saved our sales team 10 hours per week on meeting notes. ROI in the first month."
> — Sarah Chen, VP Sales @ Acme

**Avoid**:
> "Great product! Really love using it. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a solution in this space."
> — John D.

## Value Proposition Bullets

### Feature + Benefit Pattern

❌ "AI-powered analytics" (feature only)
✅ "AI-powered analytics that spot trends before your competitors" (feature + benefit)

### Examples from Research

**Cluely**:
- "12+ languages supported"
- "300ms response time"  
- "95% transcription accuracy"
- "100% undetectable"

**Polymarket**:
- "Put your money where your mouth is"
- "Trade on politics, sports, crypto, culture & more"
- "Real-time probability updates"

**Bolt.new**:
- "Website builder"
- "Web apps"
- "Mobile apps"
- "Figma & GitHub integration"

### Formatting Rules

- 3-6 bullets maximum
- Start with action verb or key benefit
- Include one specific number if possible
- Keep parallel structure
- Each bullet: 5-12 words

## Urgency & Scarcity

### Effective Patterns

| Type | Example | Why It Works |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Cohort limit | "First 100 get 50% off for life" | Specific, valuable |
| Timeline | "Launching Q1 2025" | Sets expectation |
| Invite | "Currently invite-only" | Exclusivity without pressure |
| Seats | "3 spots left in beta cohort" | If actually true |

### Patterns That Backfire

❌ Countdown timers — not used by any top 2025 pages
❌ "Limited time!" — vague, feels fake
❌ "Act now!" — pushy, damages trust
❌ Fake scarcity — users can tell, destroys credibility

### When NOT to Use Urgency

- Product not close to launch
- No genuine constraint exists
- Audience is technical (they'll see through it)
- Building long-term trust matters more

## FAQ Copy Patterns

### Question Formats

Write questions as users actually ask them:

**Good**:
- "How is this different from [Competitor]?"
- "Is my data secure?"
- "How much does it cost?"
- "Can I use this for [specific use case]?"

**Avoid**:
- "What makes [Product] the best solution?" (self-promotional)
- "Why should I choose [Product]?" (unnatural phrasing)

### Answer Guidelines

- First sentence: Direct answer
- Following: Brief elaboration
- End: Link to more info (optional)
- Length: 30-80 words typically

### Example FAQ

**Q: How is Cluely undetectable?**
A: Cluely runs entirely on your device with zero screen sharing or meeting bot integration. There's no browser extension, no system audio capture, nothing that meeting platforms can detect. Your meeting participants will never know you're using it.

## Error Messages & States

### Email Capture Success

**Good**:
- "You're on the list! We'll be in touch soon."
- "Welcome aboard! Check your inbox for a confirmation."
- "Thanks! You're #2,341 on the waitlist."

**Avoid**:
- "Form submitted successfully" (robotic)
- "Thank you for your submission" (impersonal)

### Email Capture Error

**Good**:
- "Something went wrong. Please try again."
- "Hmm, that email doesn't look right. Double-check?"

**Avoid**:
- "Error 500: Server exception" (scary)
- "Invalid input" (blaming user)

### Empty States

If showing a dashboard/preview that's empty:
- "No data yet — but you'll see results here soon!"
- "This is where your [X] will appear once you get started."
