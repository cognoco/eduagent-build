            **First**: Read docs/architecture.md and docs/project_context.md to understand the EduAgent project context, stack (Hono, Neon, Drizzle, Expo, Clerk), and architecture decisions.

            **Review priorities**:
            1. **Architectural Adherence**: Verify against monorepo structure (@eduagent/* packages), dependency flow, and architecture decisions in docs/architecture.md
            2. **Pattern Consistency**: Flag divergent implementation approaches across components, even when both are technically correct
            3. **Code Quality**: Bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues
            4. **Best Practices**: Test coverage, type safety, proper imports, test file co-location
            5. **Standards & Regressions**: Note if code falls below project standards or contradicts documented decisions

            Be constructive and specific. Focus review time on issues and improvements. Avoid nit-picking.
