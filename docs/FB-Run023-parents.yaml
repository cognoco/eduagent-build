        Hi! Saw your post about homework struggles. We built something that might help -
        an AI tutor that teaches without giving answers. Parents can finally trust their
        kid is learning, not cheating. Would love your feedback if you have 5 mins.

      body: |
        Been struggling with homework battles for years. Kid kept using ChatGPT to
        just get answers. Found this new app that uses Socratic questioning - it guides
        without giving answers. I can actually see he's learning now. Thought other
        parents might find it useful.
